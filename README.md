# 500px_challenge


This Jupyter notebook contains the code for the 500px intern tech challenge.

A simple linear classifier is trained using the MNIST data set. From the trained weights some adverserial images are created, 
in this case to 'fool' a classifier into classifying a '2' as a '6'.

The adverserial images are used to succesfully 'fool' both the linear classifier and the convolutional net. 

A more detailed discussion is included in the notebook.

Thanks,

Jonny
